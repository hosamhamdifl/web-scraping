Her newborn...",Yahoo News,"Earlier this month, Sara Grant was inside her home in Sherman, Connecticut, a small town near the New York border. Her 2-year-old was upstairs. Her newborn daughter was in her arms.,Suddenly, she saw her 4-year-old son, Gavin, running up the driveway, sobbing. A bear was close by.,“I screamed louder than I had ever screamed before,” she said.,Grant’s golden retriever, Jake, leaped forward and chased the bear off the property, driving it into the woods.,“He got multiple treats, an ice cream cone,” Grant, a 33-year-old stay-at-home parent, recalled. “He definitely got extra belly rubs that night.”,Human-bear interactions have increased dramatically in Connecticut in recent years, as the state’s population of black bears has multiplied and their geographic range has expanded. This year alone, bears in Avon crashed a parade and broke into a bakery. Elsewhere in the state, they have even invaded houses.,The danger was underscored this week in nearby Westchester County, New York, when a bear attacked a 7-year-old boy who was playing in his yard. (On Wednesday, health officials said the bear tested negative for rabies.),Worried about public safety, Gov. Ned Lamont recently signed into law a measure that allows residents to shoot and kill bears under certain circumstances: if a person “reasonably believes” a bear could seriously hurt a person or a pet, or if a bear is trying to enter a building with humans inside.,It also prohibits intentionally feeding potentially dangerous animals, like bears, on private property.,Connecticut is the only state in the Northeast with a significant bear population but no bear hunting season. The new law, essentially a stand-your-ground law for bear encounters, was a modest step that has drawn critics from all sides.,Those who advocated instead for a bear hunt say the new law did not go far enough. They argue that bears must be taught to fear humans for their own protection, and that dead bears deter live bears from populated areas.,“It’s about altering the behavior of our bears and how they perceive humans,” said Jason Hawley, the leading bear biologist at the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, adding, “Bears don’t have a negative association with humans. In fact, I’d argue that they have a positive association with humans.”,Others say the law allowing people to kill bears in self-defense is dangerous, and nearly unenforceable. They are skeptical that law enforcement officials will be able to determine if people truly felt threatened before shooting.,They argue that residents should instead be taught to bear-proof their garbage cans, to put out bird feeders only in winter and to meticulously clean their barbecue grills.,Remove the buffet, the thinking goes, and discourage the customers.,“Hunting bears is unsafe, it’s not necessary and most importantly, it’s not going to reduce interactions between people and bears,” said Annie Hornish, the Connecticut director for the Humane Society of the United States, which is part of the CT Coalition to Protect Bears.,Connecticut is hardly an outlier. Bear sightings have risen in parts of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Maryland, North Carolina, California and beyond, about 50 years after hunting restrictions and restoration efforts took effect, reviving devastated populations nationwide.,Bears have also expanded their geographic ranges. In many states, they are roaming closer and closer to cities.,As a result, many states are now debating how best to manage bears. And bear hunts are returning to states that had previously prohibited them, including in New Jersey, which re-legalized a limited cull last fall. Gov. Phil Murphy had suspended the hunt on state property in 2018, but then bear sightings and aggressive encounters increased.,In the suburbs across Connecticut, bears who venture close to people’s homes are largely looking for food, wildlife experts say.,They fish leftovers out of bins, which humans helpfully leave in a row outside on collection days. Some tip over cans, teaching their babies to forage. Others prefer bird feeders.,“Bears tend to go for the easy food,” said Deborah Clark, the animal control officer in Simsbury, a town of about 24,000 people, which has recorded 517 bear sightings so far this year.,But a few bears have also attacked humans. Last month, a bear bit a 65-year-old man in Litchfield. (The bear ran away.) Last fall, one mauled a 10-year-old in Morris. (That bear was killed.),It was this spring, after a bear bit a 74-year-old woman in Avon, that Lamont signed the law allowing people to shoot and kill bears when they are in danger.,“It started out as a nuisance, but this is no longer a nuisance,” said state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat who represents Avon and other areas.,“We have anthropomorphized them, and they are not Yogi,” she said. “That’s the problem.”,Connecticut is home to 1,000 to 1,200 bears, according to the state environmental agency, and last year, bear home entries reached a new high: 67 reported invasions and dozens more attempts.,By comparison, Maine — where bear hunting starts in August and continues through November — has more than 30,000 bears, but incidents of bears breaking into homes are rare.,Some Connecticut residents are simply annoyed by the situation.,“I used to see them once a year, if even that,” said Phil Kayan, 35, who lives in Canton. “Now, I feel like we see them once a week, if not more.”,Bears play on Kayan’s patio furniture, and he picks up after their trash feasts, strewn across his lawn.,“They’re more of a nuisance than anything,” he said.,If you see a bear, scientists recommend, make a loud noise to let it know you are there, and keep your distance. If it starts coming toward you, wave your arms, shout and back away. (Do not run. The bear is faster.) Bear spray is an effective deterrent, although it can be unpleasant for humans, too.,In Simsbury, a group of friends called “The Ladies of the Lane” give each other a heads-up via text message every time they see a bear. But it’s becoming futile, said Laura Ferraro, 33. There are just so many notifications coming in.,She said she has tried all the normal bear-scare tactics: Air horns, car horns, even banging pots and pans.,Firecrackers are the only things that scare them off. She said her family keeps a stash near the backyard.

It wasn’t until the candidates were asked about their views on education that some of their positions on queer policies were revealed., “The decline in education is one of the major reasons why our country is in decline. We need education in this country, not indoctrination,” said DeSantis, who proudly boasted about signing his state’s controversial Parental Rights in Education law — dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents — which bans any instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school.,“In Florida, we eliminated critical race theory from our K-through-12 schools. We eliminated gender ideology from our K-through-12 schools.

The lack of new movies and TV being made during the strikes could also give reality talent and crew more leverage against studios who need unscripted programming to fill holes in their schedules.,But others say that, for all of its popularity, the main thing that makes reality TV valuable is how cheap it is to produce — a feature networks aren’t likely to give away under any circumstances. There are also some signs that it may be difficult to bring enough reality stars together to force studios into making any real concessions. Some experts add that the rise of streaming may have altered the TV landscape so much that reality might not be as crucial to studios, even with no new scripted shows being made.,With the Hollywood strike dragging on for months and no resolution in sight, studios may become even more reliant on reality programming as their backlog of scripted projects that were completed before the shutdown runs out.,“The people who make these reality shows are just as talented and necessary to their programs as people who make scripted shows, but they continue to be vastly undervalued and underpaid.” — Emily St. James, ,“Unfortunately, while the two recent strikes led to a rise in reality TV, it didn’t lead to better compensation. Indeed, part of the appeal for networks is that the shows are cheaper to produce, so they’re eager to fight any attempt to make the shows more expensive.” — Ginny Hogan, ,“Reality is an extremely lucrative industry, and becomes even more important when the writers strike has knocked scripted programming off the schedule. As many have already said, ‘hot labor summer’ is proving to be an inflection point in the entertainment industry.” — Mary Kate Carr, ,“The TV landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. … The need to summon more shows may be less urgent. Viewers may even breathe a sigh of relief if they finally have time to catch up on ‘The Wire’ — or ‘The Great British Baking Show.’” — Meredith Blake and Yvonne Villarreal, ,“While a reality TV union looks a genuine possibility in the US, forming one could be complicated. Partly, this is due to the freelance and fixed-term contracts, and the revolving door of cast members. There are also questions about how it would work.” — Daisy Schofield, ,“As much as the people sitting atop this system might wish for it to be otherwise, the truth of the matter is that networks cannot outrun labor. They would have nothing to sell without it. The solution to this fundamental problem is not to turn to other people whose labor is valued lower than others. The only solution that deserves to be called a solution is to treat everyone better.” — Alex Sujong Laughlin, ,“Once studios have found a way to create this content in a cheaper way, are you going to be able to change that? ...

Prigozhin resurfaced days later, defending his mutiny in a , on Telegram: “I want you to understand that our march for justice was aimed at fighting traitors and mobilizing our society.”,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Prigozhin would move to Belarus after its president, Alexander Lukashenko, brokered a deal between Putin and the mercenary chief. Lukashenko had offered to mediate the deal, with Putin’s approval, as he has known Prigozhin personally for two decades. Peskov added that Prigozhin would receive amnesty despite orchestrating the armed mutiny and that the soldiers who had taken part would also not face any criminal action.,A little less than two months later, Prigozhin would be reported dead.",Prigozhin: From 'Putin's chef' to deadly plane crash,https://news.yahoo.com/prigozhin-putins-chef-deadly-plane-crash-174027214.html

But the fact that he went after Ramaswamy first reflects two realities.,First, Trump is so far ahead of everyone else — he leads by 40 percentage points, according to , — that it simply makes more sense for a candidate like Christie to try to knock out his second-tier rivals before going after the big guy.,And second, because Ramaswamy is on the rise — he has more than doubled his support to 8% over the last month, and he delivered some of Wednesday’s biggest applause lines — he currently represents the biggest threat to the rest of the party’s would-be Trump alternatives.,“Give me that hug,” Ramaswamy said after Christie mentioned Obama, whom the then New Jersey governor ,. “Give me that bear hug and you’ll help elect me, just like Obama.”",GOP debate: Chris Christie trashes Vivek Ramaswamy as an 'amateur' who 'sounds like ChatGPT',https://news.yahoo.com/gop-debate-chris-christie-trashes-vivek-ramaswamy-as-an-amateur-who-sounds-like-chatgpt-021307366.html
Mike Bebernes,2023-08-14T21:13:22.000Z,"So-called tent cities can be dangerous and unhealthy, but many activists say breaking them up causes even more harm to people who are already living on the...",Yahoo News,"Last month, a federal appeals court covering the western United States , to hear a case seeking to knock down rules that bar cities from forcing homeless people off the streets if there aren’t enough shelter beds available.,In response to the decision, a group of powerful conservative judges , of “paralyzing” local communities in their efforts to combat homelessness — particularly the large , that have become increasingly common in recent years.,In many areas — including deep-blue cities like ,, , and , — city leaders have ordered police to break up “tent cities” and imposed camping bans that make it illegal to set up shelters such as tents in public spaces. The moves have sparked a series of lawsuits seeking to limit cities’ ability to dismantle encampments. At the same time, cities like , and ,., have received court orders demanding that they break up large encampments within their jurisdictions.,Part of what makes the debate over encampments so contentious is that it pits groups that generally agree on the long-term solutions to homelessness against each other. Most Democratic mayors of major cities and homeless advocacy groups share a vision that includes major investments in affordable housing and mental health treatment as a way to solve the broader problem, but there are deep divisions over what to do about the acute and immediate issue of encampments.,Many advocates believe that tent cities should be left standing because they are often the safest, most secure option a lot of people have. They argue that knocking down tent cities , to address the underlying causes of homelessness while also destabilizing people’s lives and making it harder for them to access the one-on-one care they often need to get themselves off the streets.,But others argue that allowing people to keep living in encampments that are often hotbeds of crime, violence and disease only makes it more likely that they’ll never escape homelessness. They point out that most cities conduct sweeps only after a l, effort to provide people with safer and more stable housing alternatives — including, in some cases, , in areas chosen by city leaders — that can serve as a true platform toward rehabilitation.,Critics of the appeals court’s ruling say they plan to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take up their case and are hopeful that the conservative justices will ultimately strike down existing limits on when cities can force homeless people off the streets.,“Encampments can provide people with physical and emotional security, especially as record numbers of homeless people die on America’s streets. They can also provide people with a sense of agency and stability. That stability is also helpful for the volunteers and resources who serve the unhoused, because they know where to find the people they are working with.” — Livia Albeck-Ripka, ,“What should be clear is that conditions often associated with these encampments — rodent infestations, fetid surroundings, hazardous housing — are unacceptable. They don’t help the homeless, and they should have no place in America.” — Editorial, ,“Sweeping homeless camps was never going to be a solution to the crisis on our streets. … It has always been a veneer, an attempt to act like the city is responding to its residents’ concerns over the homelessness crisis on their doorsteps while never actually addressing its root cause or investing in a solution.” — Nuala Bishari, ,“You aren’t a bad person for wanting safe and clean public places. That’s something local governments are supposed to provide. That necessitates limits on their use. This is normal. Drivers are free to use the freeway but people aren’t allowed [to] walk down the middle of it. Public spaces require rules that will allow the public broadly to use and enjoy them.” — Victor Joecks, ,“A tent is a tent, but for many it’s the safest, most private space someone may have while experiencing homelessness. When encampments are removed, people lose more than their belongings or shelter, they lose stability and trust in their community.” — Amy Denhart, ,“[A sanctioned camp is] a more stable landscape. It also dramatically improves the ability of social service providers to connect regularly with those in need, gain their trust and hopefully open the door to tailored social services. It is the option that can make a difference in a matter of months, not years.” — Editorial, ,“Many of those in encampments don’t want to go to shelters because of rules against pets, drug use, and intimate relations. But there is an upper limit to the increased violence and public health dangers city residents should tolerate just because homeless people feel that the available shelters cramp their preferred lifestyles.” — Editorial, ,“This is how we end encampments. Not by raiding tents or by criminalizing people at their most vulnerable. But by working, as a community, to ensure everyone has safe, warm homes where they can live independently and with dignity.” — Amy Denhart, ,“By now, it’s clear that elected officials are more interested in managing constituent ‘frustrations’ over witnessing poverty than they are in addressing the underlying conditions that have made cities uninhabitable for poor people.” — Jonny Coleman, ",Should cities dismantle homeless camps?,https://news.yahoo.com/should-cities-dismantle-homeless-camps-211322027.html

The feature allows customers to check into their flight before the usual 24-hour mark, which often means scoring the A group and boarding among the first passengers.,If you've ever flown Southwest and checked in exactly 24 hours before your flight, you might think you'd easily get an A group position. That's not always the case. If you didn't want to take that gamble, purchasing the EarlyBird upgrade was a way to move up in the queue.,The change, which went into effect Aug. 15, will take place as the airline works on ""product enhancements."" The airline said the overhaul is part of several company initiatives meant to modernize the customer experience and strengthen their customer base.,""This focus brings an opportunity to evolve our fare and ancillary products, while maintaining the value they bring to our customers,"" said Dan Landson, a public relations adviser for Southwest.,Allowing passengers to check in early to their flights means they can land an earlier slot in the airline's boarding order. Southwest is the only major airline in the United States that arranges seating on a first-come, first-serve basis. The order in which passengers are assigned their boarding spots, from A to C and numbers 1 to 60, means they have a better chance of finding their preferred seat and a spot for luggage in the overhead bins.,With the EarlyBird option, Southwest reserves a boarding spot for passengers for a fee up to 36 hours before their departure time, but they would still need to check in to get their boarding pass.,The service starts at $15, but varies based on popularity and length of each one-way flight, according to the Southwest website. It's also subject to availability.,Southwest didn't say which flights would be limited, or how restrictions for early check-in options would be decided.,""We don't have anything more to share,"" Landson said.,Customers who can't use EarlyBird check-in can also purchase upgraded boarding passes after they check in, which allows passengers to purchase A1 through A15 boarding positions for an even higher cost. They are also subject to availability as well.,Business Select, whether it's a purchase or upgrade, also lets passengers access an A group slot, but can reach the hundreds to book.

Korin Miller,2023-08-23T19:08:44.000Z,The new COVID variant Pirola may be even more capable of infecting people who already had COVID or have been vaccinated.,Yahoo News,"Public health officials around the world say they're keeping an eye on a new COVID-19 variant that has surfaced in four countries. Called BA.2.86, aka Pirola, the variant has a lot of mutations that make it distinctly different from previous strains of the virus.,On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this new lineage may be , at infecting people who already had COVID-19 or have been vaccinated. It's not yet clear whether BA.2.86 might cause more severe illness than older variants.,Officials from the CDC , (formerly Twitter) about BA.2.86 late last week, noting that the agency is tracking the variant and that it has been detected in the U.S. ""CDC is gathering more information and will share more about this lineage as we learn it,"" the statement says.,The World Health Organization also added BA.2.86 to its , of ""currently circulating variants under monitoring."" The variant was first detected on July 24 and was added to the list ""based on the large number of mutations identified,"" the WHO says.,People in the U.S. were ,, which recently became the , in the country and now causes 20.6% of cases of the virus here. But why is Pirola concerning, and what symptoms does it cause? Here's what you need to know, according to experts.,Pirola is a newly detected COVID-19 variant with a high number of mutations in its spike protein, ,, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. According to ,, which analyzes the evolution of viruses and proteins, there are 34 mutations in Pirola's spike protein from the variant it evolved from, BA.2, and 36 variations relative to XBB.1.5, which the fall COVID booster will target. The spike protein is how the virus enters human cells, Schaffner explains.,""It has a number of mutations that make it different from Omicron — it is an Omicron grandchild,"" Schaffner says.,As of right now, there have been only seven detected cases of Pirola in the world: three in Denmark, two in the U.S., one in Israel and one in the U.K., according to the global virus database ,.,There is not a lot of information at this point about Pirola symptoms. The Michigan Health Department said in a , on X that one patient in the state who contracted it has had ""mild symptoms"" and is currently not in the hospital.,""There's not much clinical information that is known about this,"" ,, a professor and chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York, tells Yahoo Life. Schaffner says, ""It's early days, but we wouldn't expect anything different — all of these variants have the same symptoms."",Per the ,, those include:,Eris, aka EG.5, is also a descendant of Omicron. As a result, Pirola and Eris are ""part of the same family,"" Schaffner says. The two largely have different mutations in the spike protein, he says.,But, as of right now, Eris has spread more widely — in the U.S., at least — than Pirola.,""Pirola does appear to be rather contagious, and it may get into competition with Eris in terms of being more common,"" Schaffner says.,Bloom notes that many of BA.2.86's mutations are ""known to cause antibody escape,"" meaning they can get around protections like the vaccine and prior immunity on some level. ""This is similar to when we had Delta, and then Omicron showed up,"" Russo says. ""The concern around Pirola is valid and real, and it's worth monitoring."",Even though Pirola has ""a number of mutations,"" according to Russo, ""immunologically, it's better than the Delta-to-Omicron jump because this is derived from [fellow Omicron variant] BA.2."",Schaffner says that ""people shouldn't be obsessively concerned about this,"" adding, ""This is what the virus does. It's not a major new variant of concern because it doesn't produce more severe disease."",Russo expects that the fall COVID-19 booster should be able to offer at least some protection against Pirola, as well as Eris — but how much isn't entirely clear right now. ""That's why this variant has gotten a little buzz, because it has 36 different mutations,"" and that distinguishes it from the XBB.1.5 variant, on which the fall vaccine is based. ""As a result, it's possible that it may be more immune-evasive."",Doctors stress that the low number of Pirola cases worldwide right now makes it difficult to know if this variant will be an issue. ""It's brand new,"" Schaffner says.","Pirola, the new COVID variant, may infect more people than previous strains.
